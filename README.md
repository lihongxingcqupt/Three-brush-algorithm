# Algorithm Practice Record

This project is a record of my third attempt at solving algorithmic problems. It includes a variety of topics such as binary search, arrays, strings, DFS, dynamic programming, and more.

## Motivation

As a computer science student, I understand the importance of having a strong foundation in algorithms. However, I struggled with this subject in the past and was determined to improve. This project serves as a way for me to track my progress and stay motivated.

## Structure

Each day, I will attempt to solve at least one algorithmic problem and submit my solution to this repository. The problems will be categorized based on their topic and difficulty level. 

## Topics Covered

- Binary Search
- Arrays
- Strings
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Dynamic Programming

## Contributing

While contributions to this project are not necessary, they are always welcome. If you have any suggestions for improvement or would like to submit a solution to a problem, feel free to open a pull request.

## Conclusion

I am excited to see how this project will help me improve my algorithmic problem-solving skills. By consistently practicing and recording my progress, I hope to become more confident in this subject and ultimately become a better programmer.
